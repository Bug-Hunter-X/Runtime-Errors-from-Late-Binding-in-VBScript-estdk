Several strategies can address the late binding issue: 

1. **Early Binding:** Declare object variables with their specific class or type. This allows for compile-time checking and prevents runtime errors related to missing objects or methods.  Example:

```vbscript
Dim objFSO As Object
Set objFSO = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")
' ... use objFSO methods ...
Set objFSO = Nothing
```

2. **Error Handling:** Wrap potentially problematic code within error handling blocks to catch and manage runtime errors gracefully.  Example:

```vbscript
On Error Resume Next
Set objShell = CreateObject("WScript.Shell")
If Err.Number <> 0 Then
  MsgBox "Error creating Shell object: " & Err.Description
  Err.Clear
End If
' ... use objShell methods ...
On Error GoTo 0
```

3. **Conditional Checks:** Check for the existence of an object or method before attempting to use it.  This helps avoid runtime errors due to missing components.

```vbscript
If IsObject(objExcel) Then
   'Do something with Excel object
Else
   MsgBox "Excel object is not available!"
End If
```
Choosing the right approach depends on the context and the level of control you have over the environment in which the VBScript code will run.
