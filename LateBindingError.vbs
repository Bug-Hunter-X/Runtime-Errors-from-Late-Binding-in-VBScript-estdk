Late Binding in VBScript can lead to runtime errors if an object or method doesn't exist.  This is especially problematic when dealing with COM objects or external libraries where the availability of objects might depend on system configuration or other factors.  The lack of compile-time checking makes these errors difficult to detect during development.
